# DiceRoller_Project2
This is a seperate repo for the dice_roller package to see if it will host on Github, among a few other things.



Materials in the package:
1. Folders for Unity packages necessary for dice_roller hosting on Github pages.
2. 'README' to explain the contents.
3. 'LearningOutcomes.txt': for illuminating the major points of revelation and despair throughout the project.
4. 'Images' Folder: for displaying the various extra bits that I contributed to the project outside of assisting on setting up the database, aiding in getting the 'connections' in workbench to work properly, assisting on design goals with feedback to Greg on UI, helping Jon wrestle with Github, spending an obscene amount of time on api-routes to no avail, and putting the slides together.
5. The Dice package that I ultimately used the models from when my models didn't quite texture correctly in Unity (Kazadi recommended since I demonstrated that I did in fact succeed in the pipeline 98% of the way, even though the model didn't turn out perfectly.)


*Dice package ultimately utilized due to time constraints provided for free by "Random Art Attack", who was the first resource I used on youtube.
The dice package was provided for free by "Random Art Attack" on his patreon that was linked in the video description. All rights reserved to him, content used under fair use for educational growth.
